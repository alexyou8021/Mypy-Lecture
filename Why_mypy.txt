Here are some potential benefits of mypy-style static typing:

Static typing can make programs easier to understand and maintain. Type declarations can serve as machine-checked documentation. This is important as code is typically read much more often than modified, and this is especially important for large and complex programs.
Static typing can help you find bugs earlier and with less testing and debugging. Especially in large and complex projects this can be a major time-saver.
Static typing can help you find difficult-to-find bugs before your code goes into production. This can improve reliability and reduce the number of security issues.
Static typing makes it practical to build very useful development tools that can improve programming productivity or software quality, including IDEs with precise and reliable code completion, static analysis tools, etc.
You can get the benefits of both dynamic and static typing in a single language. Dynamic typing can be perfect for a small project or for writing the UI of your program, for example. As your program grows, you can adapt tricky application logic to static typing to help maintenance.
